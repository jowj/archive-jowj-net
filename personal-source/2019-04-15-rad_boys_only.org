* rad boys only
we are boys and we are rad
sometimes our cooking makes us sad

but not this time, this time we made ceviche and it was fucking bomb

** we were gonna play games first tho
noah’s desk, was so large
it was, like, the size of a barge

micah’s desk was very sad
it was so small
and so lonely
