            Hosting static sites on S3
            <p>
            Turns out this was pretty straightforward. The steps are basically:
            <ol>
                <li>decide on a dns name for your static page</li>
                <li>create an S3 bucket using that name (bullshit.jowj.net)</li> 
                <li>upload at least one file to your bucket</li>
                <li>change bucket to enable hosting static pages (ensure you set the file you uploaded to be your index)</li>
                <li>copy fully qualified aws name of endpoint and point cname (bullshit) to that endpoint</li>
                <li>boom done.</li> 
            </ol>
            <p>
            I'd had this as a "thing to do" for forever, but I guess I thought it'd be more involved. this was just really straight forward.
