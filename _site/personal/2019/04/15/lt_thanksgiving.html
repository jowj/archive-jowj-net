<h2 id="sheris-house">sheri’s house</h2>
<p>we drove around a bunch, but we started the night at sheri’s. we saw new (baby!) cats and ate good food and had our photo taken by a family friend.

<h2 id="jills-house">jill’s house</h2>
<p>i forgot to take pictures this trip so here’s some from last year:

this is jill’s back porch and it feels fake to me. so many trees it’s stunning.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/lt-thanksgiving/mule.jpeg" alt="mule" />
we played a lot of mule, an old atari 800 game. it’s a lot of fun; laura hates computer games but since this is just a board game with calculations and tabulations done by a computer she sorta fell in love</p>

<h2 id="food-at-marthas">food at martha’s</h2>
<p>i forgot to take pictures of food. and also forgot to take a lot of other pictures. i did get a funny picture of laura’s family though, it was great:
