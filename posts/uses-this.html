i love unifi<abbr class="tooltip" title="unifi makes prosumer tier network gear with more emphasis on a UI than competitors">°</abbr>&emsp13; stuff. I've got two 8 port switches (one PoE, one powered regularly, got about 3 years apart), a 3port <a href="https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-routing-switching/products/unifi-security-gateway">usg</a>, and a PoE <a href="https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/">unifi ap ac lite</a>. its really nice to have everything talk to a central place, and makes troubleshooting network issues a lot easier. Unifi <i>does</i> have some problems with reliability on new updates, so I typically update once a month, giving any new updates time to settle before I apply them. I haven't had an outtage since the first month i got the USG ✨

<p>
the rack that the unifi stuff lives in is a 19" home network rack that is (apparently) very popular in europe and aboslutely impossible to find parts for in the US. I have paid someone in germany a decent amount of money to 3D print fittings so tha I can have a better rack setup. I haven't tested the new parts yet so ymmv, but <a href="https://www.drei-d-w.de/">here</a> is the website I used.

I have an extremely old <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-us">synology</a> 4 port nas. friend gave it to me several years ago, after he had owned it for a bunch of years already. it still gets updates. its slow, and soon i'll have to upgrade to still get updates, but for now its still does me good.

I've got a <a href="https://system76.com/">system76 oryx</a> that i have used as my primary user device since 2016. Its a lovely device with a few caveats; system76 sells rebranded <a href="https://www.clevo.com.tw/index-en.asp">clevo</a> machines, and there are more than a few QC issues with these guys. the laptop keyboard doesn't work reliably at all, though in my case that's fine because I never use it as a laptop, its always attached to my full desk setup.

i have two <a href="https://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox/">ergodox infinity</a> keyboards; in the past this was so i could have one at work and one at home. now i just have one on my desk and one on my workspace, for when i inevitably change out some switches. i love these keyboards, though i do wish i could have better tenting. I also have a ~10 or 11 year old <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-blackwidow-v3-tenkeyless/RZ03-03490200-R3U1">razer black widow 10keyless</a> which is just like the one linked except doesn't have backlighting or rgb or any of that. this has lasted a respectable amount of time, though I did have to replace the USB IO board in 2020.

It now sells on ebay / amazon for 399, though when i bought it first i think i paid ~60 USD for it.

on top of nixOS i have a (i'm sure terrible) desktop environment. i use <a href="https://awesomewm.org/">awesome window manager</a> to orchestrate everything. i use <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a> as my launcher, window switcher, etc. I have come to rely on <a href="https://espanso.org/">espanso</a> to give me access to emojis and text macros - an exmaple of this is I can type like <code>:sparkles:</code> and get ✨ to appear! I also use <a href="https://github.com/resurrecting-open-source-projects/scrot">scrot</a> to give me a good UX when screenshotting. i use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">firefox</a> as my browser, and basically everything else that isn't terminal based I do in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">gnu emacs</a>.

<h4 id="orgf199d93">emacs, and all the shit i do with it</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf199d93">
<p>
emacs gets its own section because its <i>so fucking good</i>. emacs is a platform for solving problems you face on your computer. in order to be a good user of emacs you need to know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp">emacs lisp</a> (sorry lol). once you are comfortable at least fucking around with existing code and modifying it to better fit you, you become capable of addressing basically any problem you might run into.
</p>

<p>
katherine cox-buday (interviewed in uses-this, who i cite at the end of this article) describes emacs and elisp like this: "If you know a little emacs-lisp, you can begin down the path of creating your own perfect tool which will grow with you, for life."  I really like that; over years I can make a tool that's worn to exactly how I hold the keyboard, how I move between applications, etc. emacs is <i>dope</i>.
</p>

<p>
the two primary things I do in emacs:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>writing (documentation, todo lists, keeping track of my responsibilities) which is done in <a href="https://orgmode.org/">org mode</a>.</li>
<li>programming and interfacing with version control systems, which is done in various modes (for programming) and <a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a> (for vcs).</li>

as mentioned previously, my mediaserver setup hosts the <code>*arr</code> apps<abbr class="tooltip" title="these apps are radarr, sonarr, lidarr, which are download managers for tv, movies, and music">°</abbr>&emsp13;. I use plex<abbr class="tooltip" title="a personal media server">°</abbr>&emsp13; to serve media files to my users (me, friends, family). i store the configs for these things in a <code>docker-compose</code> format that deploys a <code>swarm</code>, which itself is deployed through ansible.
</p>

<p>
I use bitwarden's<abbr class="tooltip" title="bitwarden is an open source password manager.">°</abbr>&emsp13; hosted offering for my password manager. I moved to it from 1password, which I think is mostly better (especially from a polish point of view), due to the availability of clients on more platforms than 1password offered. 1pass now has a linux client, I understand, but opensource is my preference politically anyway. I've written about the process of moving to bitwarden <a href="https://me.jowj.net/posts/moving-from-1pass-to-bitwarden.html">here</a>.

this doesn't exist the fun part is fucking with what you have! here are some things i'd love to try out:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">guixSD</a> and all that implies; I'm fucking around with <code>nixOS</code> right now and i like it a lot (though, wow, rough edges). guix would be taking my like of reproducability and declarative configuration and marrying that with scheme and emacs more tightly than nix does. from a political standpoint it would also be closer to what i'd like. it seems like a pretty big usability trade off though, which is why i haven't done it yet. guixSD uses <code>hurd</code> rather than the linux kernel, and the learning curve for that would be <i>steep</i>.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixops">set up nixops</a>. if I stick with nix, i'd love to play with this. <code>guix</code> of course has a similar tool, with <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2019/towards-guix-for-devops/">guix deploy</a>, if I end up there. i love the idea of moving <i>out</i> of <code>ansible</code> and onto something that treats declarative management as a first class citizen with the OS. tbh ansible is sorta disappointing with that; why redhat didn't make ansible have better interfaces to rh specific stuff i'll never know. also now that rh is actually IBM i'm nervous about future stability ( a possibly silly case of nerves; its not like IBM hasn't been around a long time )</li>

<li>upgrade my linux laptop; i've thought about one of the newer XPS13 or 15s, as well as newer system76 options. i haven't decided what i'll end up doing. my current computer is chugging along just fine, even if i would be <i>so pleased</i> to have usbc charging and a device with fewer, uh, personality traits.</li>

<li>related to that, i'd love to standardize everything on usbc if possible. my work machine is a mbp16" which uses USBC, my personal laptop is the old standard barrel charger, my phone is fucking lightening, my backup battery is usbMicro, uuuuuugh. fuck i would love to just have like, 2 cables that did everything for me.</li>

<li>a change in phone; i'd like to experiment with alternatives to apple or android. the <a href="https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/">pinephone</a> or the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/">librem 5</a> from purism are the two options most available to me as a US based person. <a href="https://jolla.com/">sailfish by Jolla</a> seems like a great alternative if you're in the EU; SFOS is its own thing, but it has an Android compat shim that lets its own app ecosystem be bootstrapped by android. smart. my understanding is that there are band issues with EU phones in the US, though i haven't seriously looked into it. i've been on iOS since i got off of my little sidekick-like phone after a very bad bicycle accident. phones are hard to change, though. I care a lot about security, privacy, and user control, and MAN. those three things are not necessarily at loggerheads by default, but the people who champion each one of those efforts in the mobile space all have forgotten the OTHER two exist.</li>
