i had to move from mojave to catalina during the beta to test some security tooling for work (spoilers: it sucked, though now cylance has actually fixed their catalina problems) and the process was r o u g h almost entirely because of emacs.
</p>

<p>
at first there was only a single reddit post detailing what emacs users might need to know about. it linked to <a href="https://gist.github.com/dive/f64c645a9086afce8e5dd2590071dbf9">this gist</a>.
</p>

<p>
this basically says to run this lisp to add your proper emacs path to the proper exclusions and then you won't have any problems. Ok great! but that didn't work. I could now <i>launch</i> emacs from Spotlight and navigate around my Docs/Downloads/whatever, but i was totally unable to <i>swap</i> to emacs from Spotlight. this also impacted using hammerspoon as a launcher, i'm guessing because the primative behind both mechanisms is the same.

later that week, a few other people said you needed to whitelist <span class="underline">ruby's</span> executable because that was actually how homebrew installed emacs; the emacs executable is called from a ruby script (which is called by a ball rolling down a train track headed towards a toothpick which,) and thus needs to be whitelisted as well. but that didn't work either (though they were actually correct that ruby was involved).
</p>

<p>
since I could at least launch and navigate around with my then-current janky set up i stopped spending Paid Time on it and moved on. i ran the the rest of the catalina beta out and then reported back on my experience with our security tools, whatever. a few weeks ago i finally got mad enough at the situation to spend some more time looking at this and found the answer really soon! apparently a bunch of people had similar problems to me and so there are several blogs about the problem now! the one I found most helpful was <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2019/12/12/fixing-emacs-macos-catalina/">this guy</a>.

he gives a good breakdown as to why this is needed <span class="underline">instead of</span> the ruby application whitelisting. here's the quick fix:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">% cd  /Applications /Emacs.app /Contents /MacOS
% mv Emacs Emacs-launcher
% mv Emacs-x86_64- 10_14 Emacs
% cd  /Applications /Emacs.app /Contents /
% rm  -rf _CodeSignature
</pre>
</div>


<p>
this is not like, super great. its makes your configuration brittle and it will break when you update emacs! version 27 is looming i hear. but at least i can fucking swap to emacs again.
