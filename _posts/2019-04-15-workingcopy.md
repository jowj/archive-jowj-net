# editing files tracked in gif while on your phone

i open it in “working copy” and then send it to your markdown editor. then you sent it back to working copy. 

## so writing this is not bad
really, it’s a lot better than i expected it to be. i’m writing this on my phone for christ sake, but it’s still really straight forward to add a list, insert images, whatever

that is so fucking great tbh
