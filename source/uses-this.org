* uses this
[[https://usesthis.com/][uses this]] is a collection of interviews with individuals asking them about their hardware and software uses. i love this idea. of course, i'm not interesting enough to do interviews with anyone, but i /do/ think my hardware and software uses are more interesting than many of the answerer's[[margin:][i use a macbook pro! and an iphone! and google docs for collaboration! who cares :(]].

** hardware
i use a collection of hardware i've built, scrounged, or borrowed over the past 8 or 9 years. I'm separating this out into a few categories:

*** networking
i love [[https://unifi-network.ui.com][unifi stuff]]. I've got two 8 port switches (one PoE, one powered regularly, got about 3 years apart), a 3port [[https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-routing-switching/products/unifi-security-gateway][usg]], and a PoE [[https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-lite/][unifi ap ac lite]]. its really nice to have everything talk to a central place, and makes troubleshooting network issues a lot easier. Unifi /does/ have some problems with reliability on new updates, so I typically update once a month, giving any new updates time to settle before I apply them. I haven't had an outtage since the first month i got the USG âœ¨

*** servers
i have a built from scratch very old "server" that used to be my main computer. It was the first computer I built when I moved out into my own apartment. Its got a i5-2500K, which google tells me is from 2011, so I got this about a decade ago. It has 16 gigs of ram and some very shitty graphics card. it hosts my [[https://git.awful.club/jowj/adc/src/branch/master/ansible/roles/mediaserver][media server shit]], which includes the *arr apps, plex, sabnzbd, etc.

I have a raspberry pi that serves as my VPN endpoint for a site2site [[https://www.wireguard.com/][wireguard]] configuration. the pi acts as an always-on router that can talk to my home network. 

I have an extremely old [[https://www.synology.com/en-us][synology]] nas, the exact model of which I can't bring to mind because my friend gave it to me several years ago, after he had owned it for 7 or so years already. it still gets updates. its slow, and not on the latest version of anything, but it does still get security updates!

i have a collection of vms in [[https://www.digitalocean.com/][digital ocean]], the precise number of which fluctuates based on any ongoing projects. right now, I have 3: a [[https://pleroma.social/][pleroma]] server, a [[https://matrix.org][matrix]] server [[margin:][i have written previously about what i'm doing with matrix. if you're curious go look around my site.]], and a General Purpose server that hosts several things, including [[https://gitea.io/en-us/][gitea]], my znc server, and [[https://git.awful.club/hosted/mojojojo-bot][some]] [[https://git.awful.club/hosted/arke][bots]] that are either pointless, broken, or shitty (but are fun, and i made them!).

*** user devices
i have to many of these lol. i have a windows tower that is just for playing games. its got a Ryzen 3*** series CPU and 16 gb of ram. I've got a [[https://system76.com/][system76 oryx]] that i have used as my primary user device since 2016. Its a lovely device with a few caveats; system76 sells rebranded [[https://www.clevo.com.tw/index-en.asp][clevo]] machines, and there are more than a few QC issues with these guys. the laptop keyboard doesn't work reliably at all, though in my case that's fine because I never use it as a laptop, its always attached to my full desk setup.

for mobile devices i have an iPhone XS (though i'm thinking of upgrading to the new iPhone mini in the hopes that a smaller screen and lighter weight device will help with my [[https://me.jowj.net/personal/rsi.html][rsi]]), a shitty Samsung Tablet 8 (i think?) that i use to play around with android distrobutions. right now its running [[https://lineageos.org/][lineageOS]]. I also have a switch for playing games.

*** user input devices
I'm in the process of building out a version of [[https://me.micahrl.com/projects/deskmx/][my brother's deskmx project]]; i have 3 mixers (one acts as a preamp for mics, one is a mic input splitter to connect to all my devices, and 1 is just for headphones). this is still on going and i'll probably write about what i've done and what, if anything, i did different than my brother once its finished. 

i have two [[https://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox/][ergodox infinity]] keyboards; in the past this was so i could have one at work and one at home. now i just have one on my desk and one on my workspace, for when i inevitably change out some switches. i love these keyboards, though i do wish i could have better tenting. I also have a ~10 or 11 year old [[https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-blackwidow-v3-tenkeyless/RZ03-03490200-R3U1][razer black widow 10keyless]] which is just like the one linked except doesn't have backlighting or rgb or any of that. this has lasted a respectable amount of time, though I did have to replace the USB IO board in 2020.

i have a stupid collection of mice, mostly as part of a "can i help my RSI" series of experiments. God's own mouse is the [[https://www.newegg.com/logitech-g9x/p/N82E16826104261][logitech g9x]], which i had for 8 or so years before it finally gave up the ghost. i love that mouse. It now sells on ebay / amazon for around 399, though when i bought it first i think i paid ~60 USD for it. I also have [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FNJB8TT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1][logitech vertical mouse] which I am currently using for most of my computing needs, and a [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y8ZD1P5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1][benQ zowie EC1] which I hoped would adequately replace my g9x in terms of hand fit, and it did not :(.
** software
*** operating systems
<nix and debian, mac for work>
*** desktop env
<awesomeWM, rofi, syncthing, espanso, scrot>
*** emacs, and all the shit i do with it
*** programming languages
    <python / elisp for current langs. talk about shitty programming in lua too, i guess>

** my ideal setup
